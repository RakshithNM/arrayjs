/* Given an array, print the Next Greater Element (NGE) for every element.
 * The Next greater Element for an element x is the first greater element on the right side of x in the array.
 * Elements for which no greater element exist, consider the next greater element as -1.Â 
 * Examples:
 * - For an array, the rightmost element always has the next greater element as -1.
 * - For an array that is sorted in decreasing order, all elements have the next greater element as -1.
 * - For the input array [4, 5, 2, 25], the next greater elements for each element are as follows.
 * Element NGE
 * 4 --> 5
 * 5 --> 25
 * 2 --> 25
 * 25 --> -1
 * - d) For the input array [13, 7, 6, 12], the next greater elements for each element are as follows.
 * Element NGE
 * 13 --> -1
 * 7 --> 12
 * 6 --> 12
 * 12 --> -1
